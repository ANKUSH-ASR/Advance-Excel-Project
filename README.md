🚀 Exciting News ! I just completed my first Excel project with an interactive dashboard! 🎉 

✨ The project titled 'Vrinda Store Report 2022' aimed to help the store create an annual sales report , analyze customer behavior and boost customer sales .
I performed various tasks such as data cleaning ,processing ,analysis ,visualization and report creation.

❓ The project also answered important questions such as :-
- How do sales and orders compare using a single chart ?
- Which month had the highest sales and orders?
- Who purchased more , men or women in 2022 ?
- What are different order statuses in 2022?
- Which are the top 5 states contributing to sales?
- What is the relation between age and gender based on the number of orders?

📈 Based on the report insights ,here are the outcomes of the sales :-

 1️⃣ Women are more likely to purchase (65%) than men.
 
 2️⃣ Maharashtra , Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh were the top contributors to sales (35%).
 
 3️⃣ The adult age group (30-49 yrs) made the most contributions(50%).
 
 4️⃣ Amazon, Flipkart and Myntra channels were the top contributors(80%).

🎯 The final conclusion to improve store sales is to target women customers of age group (30-49 yrs) living in Maharashtra , Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh by showing ads/offers/coupons available on Amazon ,Flipkart and Myntra.
